# What is this?

This is a personal project that aims to be a space where I implement data structures and algorithms in Ruby. 

As I write this, this isn't really intended to be useful for anyone other than myself, but hey maybe it will be!

# Data Structures

## Stack

## Trees

### MinHeap

# Algorithms
